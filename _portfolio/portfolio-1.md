## ðŸ’» Projects

Here are some of the projects Iâ€™ve uploaded to GitHub, showcasing my work and contributions:

### 1. **Adversarial Attacks in Human Perception**
This repository generates targeted and untargeted adversarial attacks that fool an ensamble of convolutional pretrained neural networs using iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method (iFGSM) and Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM).    

### 2. **Coded Aperture**
This collaborative project done with [@Eitan-Sprejer](https://github.com/Eitan-Sprejer) consists in a repository that simulates the coded aperture imaging technique. It allows users to capture images using a coded aperture mask, which can be used for various applications such as computational photography, image reconstruction, and more.

### 3. **Sistemas Complejos (Complex Systems)**
In this coursework project, my peer [@AgustinBrusco](https://github.com/agustinbrusco) and I studied different ways of modeling **complex systems** dynamics. We explored systems like the Van Der Pol and Duffing oscillators, the Burgers equation using finite differences or **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)**, and the **Korteweg-de Vries equation** using the Runge-Kutta or a pseudospectral method.

### 4. **Ising Model in 2D**
This collaborative project simulates the **2D Ising Model** using the metropolis algorithm.
