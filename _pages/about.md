## ðŸ”¬ About Me

Hi, I'm **Trinidad Borrell**â€”a passionate **physics student** and **Python enthusiast**. I am about to complete my **Licenciatura in Physics** *(Equivalent to BSc + MSc)* at the **University of Buenos Aires**. 

Currently, I'm working at [Consciousness, Culture, and Complexity lab](https://www.cocucolab.org/), exploring the effect of **adversarial attacks** on human perception. (Check out some related literature here: [[Veerabadran V. et al](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40499-0#Sec18)], [[Dujmovic M. et al](https://elifesciences.org/articles/55978.pdf)], [[Zhou Z. et al](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08931-6.pdf)])

## ðŸ§  Looking ahead

As I continue to build my expertise in knowledge in computational approaches, Iâ€™m excited about the opportunities that will allow me to push the boundaries of what I can achieve. My focus remains on applying computational tools to solve complex problems in neuroscience and beyond.
