## ðŸ”¬ About Me

Hi, I'm **Trinidad Borrell**â€”a passionate **physics student** and **Python enthusiast**. I am about to complete my **Licenciatura in Physics** *(Equivalent to BSc + MSc)* at the **University of Buenos Aires**.

Currently, I'm working at [Consciousness, Culture, and Complexity lab](https://www.cocucolab.org/), exploring the effect of **adversarial attacks** on human perception. (Check out some related literature here: [[Veerabadran V. et al](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40499-0#Sec18)], [[Dujmovic M. et al](https://elifesciences.org/articles/55978.pdf)], [[Zhou Z. et al](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08931-6.pdf)])

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trinidad-borrell/). You can also follow me on Twitter for updates and discussions: [[@triniborrell](https://x.com/triniborrell)].

## ðŸ’» Projects

Here are some of the projects Iâ€™ve uploaded to GitHub, showcasing my work and contributions:

### 1. **Adversarial Attacks in Human Perception**
This repository generates targeted and untargeted adversarial attacks that fool an ensamble of convolutional pretrained neural networs using iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method (iFGSM) and Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM).    

### 2. **Coded Aperture**
This collaborative project done with [@Eitan-Sprejer](https://github.com/Eitan-Sprejer) consists in a repository that simulates the coded aperture imaging technique. It allows users to capture images using a coded aperture mask, which can be used for various applications such as computational photography, image reconstruction, and more.

### 3. **Sistemas Complejos (Complex Systems)**
In this coursework project, my peer [@AgustinBrusco](https://github.com/agustinbrusco) and I studied different ways of modeling **complex systems** dynamics. We explored systems like the Van Der Pol and Duffing oscillators, the Burgers equation using finite differences or **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)**, and the **Korteweg-de Vries equation** using the Runge-Kutta or a pseudospectral method.

### 4. **Ising Model in 2D**
This collaborative project simulates the **2D Ising Model** using the metropolis algorithm.

## ðŸ§  Looking Ahead

As I continue to build my expertise in  knowledge in computational approaches, Iâ€™m excited about the opportunities that will allow me to push the boundaries of what I can achieve. My focus remains on applying computational tools to solve complex problems in neuroscience and beyond.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub! I look forward to sharing more projects and ideas in the future.
